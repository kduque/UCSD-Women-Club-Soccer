                <h3>Tritons Fall in Regional Quarterfinals</h3>

                <p>Very early in the morning the day after a 3-0 win against the University of Arizona, the UC San Diego Women's Club Soccer team was tied for first place in the bracket with the Cal Poly Mustangs which was settled by penalty kicks. In goal for the Tritons was Captain Amy Schwartz with the Mustangs shooting first. Despite the good effort, only two girls on the Tritons side were able to score, those being Brenna Isbell and Natasha Springer, with a notable save by Schwartz and Cal Poly was able to win the shootout 4 goals to 2. The Tritons still moved on as they were second in the bracket and were up against CSU Northridge in the quarterfinals. Both teams started off slow, having to adjust to the strong winds. Although CSUN gained most of the possession at the start, the Tritons were soon able to adjust and attack with a chip from midfield to forward, Olivia Hadidian, who took a shot from outside the box which went right past the outside of the goalpost. Both teams had scoring opportunities, but were unable to score before halftime. Once the second half started, both teams were battling hard for the win, with great balls from the Triton's defense by Olivia Herrera and Springer to the forwards which initiated opportunistic attacks including a run and cross by Kelly Weldon, but the Tritons were unable to get an end on it. The forty minute half was over and it was time for one sudden death over time period and straight to penalty kicks if no goal was scored. Again, both teams went out hard knowing they had to score and around 6 minutes into overtime, Northridge was able to get a cross near the end line and although it was stopped by keeper Schwartz, it was rebounded and regained by CSUN who was able to score, ending the game. The finals score was 1-0 CSU Northridge, but it was a great weekend for the Tritons at Regionals, with memorable moments and an impressive team effort.</p>
